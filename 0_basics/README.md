## Competitive Programming

https://github.com/ShahjalalShohag/Competitive-Programming-A-Complete-Guideline?tab=readme-ov-file#problems-and-algorithms

### How to Read Problem Statements?

- Read the problem statement thoroughly. Try to understand what the problem is asking you to do.
- Identify the key information, constraints, and requirements.
- Break the problem down into smaller parts or subproblems.
- Pay attention to input-output limitations and samples provided in the statement.
- Analyze the sample test cases and try to understand the problem better.
- Check out the notes section of the problem statement. It may contain some useful information.
- Use pen and paper to draw stuff to better understand the problem.
- If you are still confused, try to read the problem statement again.

### How to Solve a Problem?

<details>
  <summary><strong>1. Understand the problem statement</strong></summary>
  <p>This is crucial. Make sure you understand what the problem is asking for, the constraints you have to work with, and the input and output formats. Misunderstanding any part of the problem can lead to a solution that doesn't work.</p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>2. Break It Down</strong></summary>
  <p>Most problems are easier to solve when broken down into smaller, manageable parts. Identify the different components of the problem and try to understand how they relate to each other.</p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>3. Make a Plan/Algorithm</strong></summary>
  <p>Once you've broken down the problem, you should have a better idea of how to solve it. Formulate a strategy for solving the problem. Use pen and paper to write down the steps you need to take to solve the problem. You should have a clear idea of your solution before you start writing the code for it.</p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>4. Write the Code</strong></summary>
  <p>Once you have a solid plan, you can start coding. Write your code carefully, keeping it as clean and clear as possible. This will make it easier to debug and improve later.</p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>5. Test Your Solution</strong></summary>
  <p>Once you've written your code, you should test it against the sample test cases provided in the problem statement. If your solution passes all the sample test cases, you can submit it. You can also try to come up with your own test cases to check your solution.</p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>6. Debug and Improve</strong></summary>
  <p>If your solution doesn't pass all the sample test cases, you should debug it. Go through your code line by line and check if it's doing what you expect it to do. If you find any bugs, fix them and test your solution again.</p>
  <code>Print and Check</code>
</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>7. Optimize Your Code</strong></summary>
  <p>Once your code is working correctly, see if there's any way to make it more efficient. Can you reduce its time complexity? Can you use less memory? Optimizing your code is good practice.</p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>8. Submit Your Solution</strong></summary>
  <p>Once you're satisfied with your solution, you can submit it. Even if you're confident in your solution, be prepared for the possibility of it being rejected. If it is, use it as an opportunity to learn and improve.</p>
</details>

    # Always try to solve the problem using bruteforce.
    # Then optimize it.

    while(fail){
      - If previous approach fail then try another approaches.
      - Make algorithm first, code it later.
    }

### Verdicts

Once you submit your code, you will get a verdict based on multiple criteria. The most common verdicts are:

<details>
  <summary><strong>Accepted (AC)</strong></summary>
  <p>Your solution passed all test cases! Good job!</p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>Wrong Answer (WA)</strong></summary>
  <p>Your program gave an incorrect output for a specific test case. As a result, it wasn't executed on the remaining test set. Note that the test cases are hidden, so you won't be able to see the test case on which your program failed.</p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>Compilation Error (CE)</strong></summary>
  <p>Your code failed to compile, likely due to a syntactic error. Solve the error by testing your code locally. Make sure you've selected the correct compiler upon submission.</p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>Runtime Error (RE)</strong></summary>
  <p>A fault occurred during the execution of your program. This could be due to issues like accessing an out-of-bound array index, dividing by zero, and so on.</p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>Time Limit Exceeded (TLE)</strong></summary>
  <p>Your program took more time to run than the specified limit. Note that, the execution time is the maximum time taken by your program to run on any test case. So, if your program is taking too much time on a specific test case, then it will get a TLE verdict.</p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>Memory Limit Exceeded (MLE)</strong></summary>
  <p>Similar to TLE, your program used more memory than the allowed limit.</p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>Presentation Error (PE)</strong></summary>
  <p>Your program ran successfully, and the output is correct, but the <em>output format</em> is incorrect. This is usually due to a missing space, newline, or an extra space or newline.</p>
</details>

Note that your code first gets compiled and then gets executed. That's why you will get a CE verdict even before it gets executed.

### Data Types

https://usaco.guide/general/data-types?lang=cpp
![data_type](https://i.ibb.co.com/mCSZKPF/Screenshot-from-2024-10-02-23-41-19.png)

```
* floating point numbers are not exact.
* so it's generally a bad idea to compare two floating-point numbers for exact equality (==).
* Hence, we should always expect that floating point numbers are slightly o↵.

    if (abs(a-b) < 1e-9) {
        // a and b are equal
    }
```

- The usual floating point types in competitive programming are the 64-bit double
  and, as an extension in the g++ compiler, the 80-bit long double. In most cases,
  double is enough, but long double is **more accurate**.

- Some numbers cannot
  be represented accurately as floating point numbers, and there will be rounding
  errors.

* Note that while floating point numbers are inaccurate, integers up to a certain
  limit can still be represented accurately. For example, using double, it is possible to accurately represent all integers whose absolute value is at most 2<sup>53</sup>.

Booleans require 1 byte (8 bits) of storage, not 1 bit, wasting the other 7 bits of storage. To use less memory, one can use bitsets (std::bitset in C++ / BitSet in Java).

https://usaco.guide/CPH.pdf#page=16

```
long long x = 123456789123456789LL;

subtle error:
    int a = 123456789;
    long long b = a*a;
    cout << b << "\n"; // -1757895751
    solve it using (long long)a*a
```

Usually contest problems are set so that the type long long is enough. Still,
it is good to know that the g++ compiler also provides a 128-bit type \_\_int128_t
with a value range of −2<sup>127</sup> . . . 2<sup>127</sup> − 1 or about −10<sup>38</sup> . . . 10<sup>38</sup>. However, this type
is not available in all contest systems

### String

#### Input with spaces

- cin.getline(s,n);
- using getline() instead of get()

      char c[100];
      int n; cin>>n;
      //cin.get(); //without these we find n-1 getline()..
      //because n '\n'..counted as first line. upto '\n' it count a line
      //char ch = getchar();//alternative
      cin.ignore();
      while(n--){
        cin.getline(c,100);
      }

<code>string(int, char)</code> n=3, c='a' => "aaa"

<code>char c = num + '0'</code>
<code>int num = 'c' - '0'</code>

### Time and Space Complexity

https://usaco.guide/bronze/time-comp?lang=cpp

- Big O notation, which expresses
  worst-case time complexity as a function of
  $n$
  as
  $n$
  gets arbitrarily large.

![Time Complexity](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*xq73u1N7ZsTE2MJ9jsj0CA.png)

- 1s <--> 10<sup>8</sup> Operations

### Common Complexities and Constraints

- Mathematical formulas that just calculate an answer: **O(1)**
- Binary search: **O(log⁡n)**
- Sorted set/map or priority queue: **O(log⁡n)** per operation

- Prime factorization of an integer, or checking primality or compositeness of an integer naively: **O(n)**
- Reading in n items of input: **O(n)**
- Iterating through an array or a list of nn elements: **O(n)**
- Sorting: usually O(nlog⁡n) for default sorting algorithms (mergesort, Collections.sort, Arrays.sort)
- Java Quicksort Arrays.sort function on primitives: **O(n<sup>2</sup>)**

- Iterating through all subsets of size k of the input elements: **O(n<sup>k</sup>)**. For example, iterating through all triplets is **O(n<sup>3</sup>)**
- Iterating through all subsets: **O(2<sup>n</sup>)**~(1<<n)
- Iterating through all permutations: **O(n!)**

### End Of File (EOF)

Input untill end of file

    while(cin>>x){
      ans+=x;
    }

#

### Fast Input & Output

https://usaco.guide/general/fast-io?lang=cpp

<code>ios::sync_with_stdio(false)</code>

This disables the synchronization between the C and C++ standard streams. By default, all standard streams are synchronized, which in practice allows you to mix C- and C++-style I/O and get sensible and expected results. If you disable the synchronization, then C++ streams are allowed to have their own independent buffers, which makes mixing C- and C++-style I/O an adventure.

<code>cin.tie(nullptr)</code>

This unties cin from cout. Tied streams ensure that one stream is flushed automatically before each I/O operation on the other stream.

By default cin is tied to cout to ensure a sensible user interaction.
