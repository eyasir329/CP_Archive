- all pattern matching can be solved through hashing

- x can be anything (does't matter)
- collision as less as possible
- p as much as large

- when hash not work (use two mod )

- when we save our hash in set/map -> no. of check increasing -> then maybe need double mod


- application

- no. of distinct substring

- palindrome subarray

- debug -> two mod = same, x1=x2= 100

- lexicographically smaller

- hash can work on dynamic string (help with segment tree) 

- minimal length of p... that can cover whole string
