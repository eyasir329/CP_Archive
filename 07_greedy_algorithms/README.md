## Greedy

![gd](gd1.png)

> Greedy problems involve making the best local choice at each step in the hope of achieving a globally optimal solution. These problems require the greedy-choice property to ensure the local optimum leads to the global optimum.

- sometimes local optimal not lead to global optimal - which is not greedy

- all summation of current solution is absotute solution -> greedy
- all state is independent

**Example**: The Activity Selection Problem or Huffman Coding.
