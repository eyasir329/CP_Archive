<p>Combinatorics studies methods for counting combinations of objects. Usually,
the goal is to find a way to count the combinations efficiently without generating
each combination separately.</p>

<p>A combinatorial problem can often be solved using a recursive function.
Sometimes, a recursive formula can be replaced with a closed-form formula.</p>
