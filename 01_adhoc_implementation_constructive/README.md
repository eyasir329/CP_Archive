## Some Problem Categories

### Adhoc Problems

Adhoc problems **don't rely on specific algorithms or data structures**. They require creative, case-by-case solutions based on the problem description.

**Example**: Finding the second-largest number in a list.

---

### Implementation Problems

These problems focus on **correctly implementing a sequence of steps or rules**, often based on real-world processes or detailed problem instructions.

**Example**: Simulating a traffic light system based on a set of predefined rules.

---

### Constructive Problems

Constructive problems require building a solution that satisfies a set of constraints. You develop the answer step by step rather than just determining if something is possible.

**Example**: Constructing a valid sequence of parentheses.

<pre>
- check careful about the constraints.
- mostly constructive problems have multiple solutions.
</pre>

### Greedy Problems

Greedy problems involve making the best local choice at each step in the hope of achieving a globally optimal solution. These problems require the greedy-choice property to ensure the local optimum leads to the global optimum.

**Example**: The Activity Selection Problem or Huffman Coding.
