example:

- [spoj_VECTAR8 - Primal Fear](./1_primes_and_divisors/1_primes/spoj_VECTAR8_Primal%20Fear.cpp)

<pre>
They are afraid of the prime numbers (without the digit zero), that remain prime no matter how many of the leading digits are omitted.

For example, they are afraid of 4632647 because it doesn't have the digit 0 and each of its truncations (632647, 32647, 2647, 647, 47, and 7) are primes. 

#given a number of N, find out the number of primes not greater that N, that changu and mangu are afraid of.

T ≤ 10^5, 1 ≤ N < 10^6

if(num has digit 0)return false;
if(it's truncations not prime)return false;
otherwise true;

- [spoj_HS08PAUL_A conjecture of Paul Erdős](./1.primes/spoj_HS08PAUL_A%20conjecture%20of%20Paul%20Erdős.cpp)

<pre>
#find the number of (positive) primes not larger than n which are of the form x2+y4 (where x and y are integers).
