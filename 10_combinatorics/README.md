## Combinatorics

### Counting

- factorial

      n! is te number of ways to arrange n distinct objects in a line.

- combinations

      # order don't matter
      nCr is the number of ways to choose r objects from n distinct objects.
      nCr = n!/(r!(n-r)!)

- permutations

      # order matter
      nPr is the number of ways to choose r objects from n distinct objects and arrange them in line.
      nPr = n!/(n-r)!
