### **Stars and Bars Theorem**

**Problem:**
Given \( K \) variables, 
```math
 a_1, a_2, a_3, \dots, a_K 
```
, and a value \( N \), how many ways can we write:

```math
a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + \dots + a_K = N,
```

where 
```math
 a_1, a_2, a_3, \dots, a_K 
 ```
  are non-negative integers?

**Example:**
For \( K = 3 \) and \( N = 2 \), there are 6 solutions:

```math
\begin{array}{c|c|c}
a_1 & a_2 & a_3 \\
\hline
2 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 2 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 2 \\
1 & 1 & 0 \\
1 & 0 & 1 \\
0 & 1 & 1 \\
\end{array}
```

**Solution:**
The problem can be visualized using the Stars and Bars method. Consider distributing \( N \) stars in \( K \) partitions, where each partition represents a variable. The total number of positions available is \( N + K - 1 \), consisting of \( N \) stars and \( K - 1 \) bars. 

We need to select \( N \) positions for the stars, and the remaining \( K - 1 \) positions will automatically be for the bars. This is equivalent to the binomial coefficient:

```math
\binom{N + K - 1}{N} \quad \text{or equivalently} \quad \binom{N + K - 1}{K - 1}.
```

For our example, where \( K = 3 \) and \( N = 2 \):

```math
\binom{2 + 3 - 1}{2} = \binom{4}{2} = 6.
```

### **Stars and Bars Theorem:**

For any pair of positive integers \( N \) and \( K \), the number of \( K \)-tuples of non-negative integers whose sum is \( N \) is:

```math
\binom{N + K - 1}{N} \quad \text{or equivalently} \quad \binom{N + K - 1}{K - 1}.
```

This is also known as the **Ball and Urn Theorem**:
- **Ball and Urn Theorem:** If we have \( K \) distinguishable containers (urns) and \( N \) indistinguishable balls (stars), the number of ways to distribute them is:

```math
\binom{N + K - 1}{N} \quad \text{or equivalently} \quad \binom{N + K - 1}{K - 1}.
```

---

### **Extensions of Stars and Bars**

1. **Positive Number of Stars in Each Partition:**

   What if every partition must have at least one star? In this case, we place one star in each partition and subtract those from the total. This transforms the problem into:

```math
a_1 + a_2 + \dots + a_K = N, \quad \text{where} \quad a_1, a_2, \dots, a_K > 0.
```

This is equivalent to solving:

```math
a'_1 + a'_2 + \dots + a'_K = N - K,
```

where 
```math
a'_1, a'_2, \dots, a'_K \geq 0 .
```
 The number of solutions is then:

```math
\binom{N - 1}{K - 1}.
```

2. **Lower Bound with Each Partition:**

   If each partition \( a_i \) has a lower bound \( L_i \), we subtract \( L_i \) from each variable:

```math
a_1 + a_2 + \dots + a_K = N, \quad \text{where} \quad a_1 \geq L_1, a_2 \geq L_2, \dots, a_K \geq L_K.
```

This becomes equivalent to:

```math
a'_1 + a'_2 + \dots + a'_K = N - (L_1 + L_2 + \dots + L_K),
```

where 
```math
 a'_1, a'_2, \dots, a'_K \geq 0 .
 ```
 The number of solutions is:

```math
\binom{N - (L_1 + L_2 + \dots + L_K) + K - 1}{K - 1}.
```

3. **Equation with Inequality:**

   If the problem is to find:

```math
a_1 + a_2 + \dots + a_K \leq N,
```

there are two ways to approach it:

   - **Garbage Partition Method:** Introduce an extra partition to handle the inequality. This transforms the equation into:

```math
a_1 + a_2 + \dots + a_K + a_{K+1} = N,
```

where 
```math
 a_{K+1} 
 ```
 is the "garbage" partition. The number of solutions is:

```math
\binom{N + K}{K}.
```

   - **Vertical Sum of Pascal's Triangle:** Another method involves summing the results of the equation for each possible sum from \( 0 \) to \( N \), leading to:

```math
\sum_{i=0}^{N} \binom{N + K - i - 1}{K - 1}.
```

This is equivalent to the vertical sum of a column in Pascal's Triangle, which simplifies to:

```math
\binom{N + K}{K}.
```

4. **Upper Bound with Each Partition:**

   When there is an upper bound on each partition, Dynamic Programming (DP) is a potential solution. The idea is to iterate through each partition, keeping track of the remaining stars, and explore all possible placements for the stars. This method may work for small constraints but can become complex for large inputs.

   The basic idea is to define a DP function like:

```cpp
int dp(int partition, int stars) {
    int res = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < upperLimit[partition]; i++) {
        res += dp(partition + 1, stars - i);
    }
    return res;
}
```

---

### **Conclusion:**

The Stars and Bars Theorem is a powerful combinatorial tool for distributing indistinguishable objects into distinguishable bins. The theorem, along with its extensions and variations, provides solutions to a wide range of problems in combinatorics.

## üç™ **Distributing Identical Cookies to Distinct Kids**

We want to distribute **7 identical cookies** to **4 distinct kids** (let‚Äôs name them A, B, C, D). The key question is:

> **How many ways can we do this?**

The answer depends on whether:

1. **Kids can receive zero cookies** (some may get none).
2. **Every kid must get at least one cookie**.

We'll analyze **both cases** carefully.

---

## ‚ú® Motivating Example

You have **7 cookies** to give to **4 kids**.  
How many ways can you do this?

Take a moment to think about how you might solve this problem. You may assume that it is acceptable to give a kid **no cookies**. Also, the cookies are **all identical** and the order in which you give out the cookies **does not matter**.

---

### ‚ùå A Wrong Way to Think

You might guess:

```math
4^7 = 16384
```

Why? Because each cookie can go to any of the 4 kids.  
But this **overcounts**‚Äîit treats order as important. For instance:

- Giving 6 cookies to A and 1 to B is the same as giving 1 to B and 6 to A.

So this method counts multiple arrangements that result in the **same distribution**.

---

### ‚úÖ What Do Valid Outcomes Look Like?

One approach is to represent outcomes as:

- A **tuple of integers**:  
  Example: `3 1 1 2` means A gets 3, B and C get 1 each, D gets 2.

- A **string of letters**:  
  Example: `AAABCDD` ‚Äì 3 for A, 1 for B, 1 for C, 2 for D.

But since cookies are identical, the **order doesn‚Äôt matter**, so we consider all strings like `AAABCDD`, `ABAADCD`, etc., as the **same**.

---

### üåü Stars and Bars Representation

Represent cookies with `*` and divide among kids using bars (`|`).  
We need:

- 7 stars (cookies)
- 3 bars (dividers between 4 kids)

#### Example:

```text
***|*|*|**
```

Means:

- A gets 3
- B gets 1
- C gets 1
- D gets 2

#### Another Example:

```text
|***||****
```

Means:

- A gets 0
- B gets 3
- C gets 0
- D gets 4

‚úÖ Any arrangement of 7 stars and 3 bars represents a valid distribution.

---

## ‚úÖ Case 1: Kids **Can Receive Zero Cookies**

We are choosing positions for 3 bars among 10 spots (7 stars + 3 bars):

```math
\binom{10}{3} = \boxed{120}
```

### ‚úÖ General Formula

```math
\binom{n + k - 1}{k - 1}
```

Where:

- \( n = 7 \): cookies
- \( k = 4 \): kids

So:

```math
\binom{7 + 4 - 1}{4 - 1} = \binom{10}{3} = \boxed{120}
```

---

## ‚úÖ Case 2: Every Kid **Must Get ‚â• 1 Cookie**

First, give 1 cookie to each kid.  
Remaining cookies: \( 7 - 4 = 3 \)

Now distribute 3 identical cookies to 4 kids, allowing zeros:

```math
\binom{6}{3} = \boxed{20}
```

### ‚úÖ Alternate View (Stars and Bars Restriction)

To ensure each kid gets at least one:

- Bars cannot be adjacent (would skip a kid)
- Bars must go **between** stars

There are 6 gaps between 7 stars. Choose 3:

```math
\binom{6}{3} = \boxed{20}
```

### ‚úÖ General Formula

```math
\binom{n - 1}{k - 1}
```

Where:

- \( n = 7 \): cookies
- \( k = 4 \): kids

So:

```math
\binom{6}{3} = \boxed{20}
```

\text{Indist. cookies to dist. kids (‚â•1 each)} & \binom{n - 1}{k - 1} & \binom{6}{3} = 20 \\\\
\hline
\end{array}

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Confusion

If you answered **20**, you probably assumed each kid must get at least one cookie.  
But unless specified, **zero is allowed**, so the correct answer is:

### üìå Legend:
- \( n \): total items (cookies, balls, etc.)
- \( k \): number of bins/people/variables
- \( r \): minimum or maximum bound for each \( a_i \)

---

## üß† Full Reasoning and Derivations


### üîµ **Scenario 1: No Restriction (Each gets ‚â•0)**

**Goal:** Distribute \( k \) indistinguishable balls into \( n \) distinguishable bins.

**Formula:**
```math
\binom{n + k - 1}{k} = \binom{n + k - 1}{n - 1}
```

**Reasoning:**

- Use \( k \) stars (\(\*\)) and \( n - 1 \) bars (\(|\)) to separate the bins.
- Total symbols = \( k + n - 1 \). Choose positions for the bars:
```math
\text{Ways} = \binom{k + n - 1}{n - 1}
```

**Example:**
Distribute 7 cookies to 4 kids:
```math
\binom{7 + 4 - 1}{3} = \binom{10}{3} = 120
```

---

### üü° **Scenario 2: Each Gets At Least 1**

**Goal:** Distribute \( k \) indistinguishable balls into \( n \) bins, each with ‚â•1.

**Formula:**
```math
\binom{k - 1}{n - 1}
```

**Reasoning:**

- Give 1 ball to each bin ‚Üí \( k - n \) balls left.
- Now it's Scenario 1 on \( k' = k - n \) and \( n \) bins:
```math
\binom{(k - n) + n - 1}{n - 1} = \binom{k - 1}{n - 1}
```

**Example:**
7 cookies, 4 kids each gets ‚â•1:
```math
\binom{6}{3} = 20
```

---

### üü† **Scenario 3: Each Gets At Least \( r \)**

**Goal:** Distribute \( N \) indistinguishable balls into \( n \) bins, each getting ‚â•\( r \).

**Formula:**
```math
\binom{N - nr + n - 1}{n - 1}
```

**Reasoning:**

- Give \( r \) balls to each bin ‚Üí \( N - nr \) left.
- Now distribute those freely (Scenario 1):
```math
\binom{(N - nr) + n - 1}{n - 1}
```

**Example:**
20 balls, 5 bins, each gets ‚â•2:

- Give 2 each ‚Üí 10 used, 10 left.
```math
\binom{10 + 5 - 1}{4} = \binom{14}{4}
```

---

### üî¥ **Scenario 4: Each Gets At Most \( r \)**

**Goal:** Distribute \( N \) indistinguishable balls into \( n \) bins, each getting ‚â§\( r \).

**Formula (Inclusion-Exclusion):**
```math
\sum_{m=0}^{\left\lfloor \frac{N}{r+1} \right\rfloor} (-1)^m \binom{n}{m} \binom{N - m(r+1) + n - 1}{n - 1}
```

**Reasoning:**

- Start with total ways without restriction.
- Subtract "bad" cases where ‚â•1 bin exceeds \( r \).
- Use PIE (Principle of Inclusion-Exclusion):
  - For each subset of \( m \) bins, remove cases where each of them has ‚â• \( r + 1 \).

---

### ‚ú® Visual Representation

Each distribution corresponds to a stars-and-bars string.  
Example with 7 cookies, 4 kids:

- `***|*|*|**` ‚Üí [3, 1, 1, 2]
- `|***||****` ‚Üí [0, 3, 0, 4]
- `****|*|*|` ‚Üí [4, 1, 1, 1]

Each arrangement of \( k \) stars and \( n - 1 \) bars uniquely represents one valid distribution.

---

### **Reasoning 1: Stars and Bars**

Arranging \( k \) stars (\(\ast\)) and \( n - 1 \) bars (\(|\)) is the same as saying there are \( k + n - 1 \) positions:
```math
\underbrace{\_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_}_{k + n - 1}
```
You want to fill \( k \) of them with stars and the remaining with bars. Thus, you are choosing \( k \) positions out of \( k + n - 1 \) total positions, or equivalently, choosing \( n - 1 \) positions for the dividers out of \( n + k - 1 \) total spots, resulting in a total of:
```math
\binom{k + n - 1}{n - 1}
```
ways.

---

### **Reasoning 2: Repeated Urns Interpretation**

If you could only put one ball in each urn, there would be \( \binom{n}{k} \) possibilities. However, since repetition of balls is allowed, this formula does not apply directly.

Think of the problem as having \( n \) "urns" and \( k \) additional "repeat" urns labeled "repeat 1st", "repeat 2nd", ..., "repeat \( k-1 \)-th". After placing balls in the urns, imagine that any balls in the "repeat" urns are stacked on top of the correct balls in the first \( n \) urns, moving from left to right. This gives a one-to-one correspondence between the non-repeating arrangements in the new urns and the repeat-allowed arrangements in the original urns.

For example, consider distributing 4 balls into 5 urns:
- **No repeats:** \( 1, 2, 3, 4 \)
- **One repeat:** \( 1, 1, 2, 4 \rightarrow 1, 2, 4, r_1 \)
- **Two repeats:** \( 1, 2, 2, 2 \rightarrow 1, 2, r_2, r_3 \)
- **Two urns with multiple balls:** \( 4, 4, 5, 5 \rightarrow 4, 5, r_1, r_2 \)

Since there are \( n + k - 1 \) total urns, and \( k \) balls, the number of possible scenarios is simply:
```math
\binom{n + k - 1}{k}
```
By the symmetry property of binomial coefficients, we can also express this as:
```math
\binom{n + k - 1}{k} = \binom{n + k - 1}{n - 1}
```

---

### ‚úÖ Final Takeaway

Use **Stars and Bars** when:

- Objects are **indistinguishable**
- Bins are **distinguishable**
- You're counting valid **distributions** of total objects

üß© **What‚Äôs the problem asking?**

You're given a number $M$, and you want to know:

> **How many ordered tuples** $(a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_N)$ **of positive integers** multiply to exactly $M$?

Example: If $M = 12$ and $N = 2$, some valid tuples are $(2,6), (3,4), (1,12)$, etc.

üìå **Core Concept**

We break this down by using **prime factorization**.

If:

$$
M = p_1^{b_1} \cdot p_2^{b_2} \cdots p_k^{b_k}
$$

Then, each $a_i$ can be written using the same primes:

$$
a_i = p_1^{c_{i1}} \cdot p_2^{c_{i2}} \cdots p_k^{c_{ik}}
$$

Now, when you multiply all the $a_i$'s together:

$$
a_1 a_2 \cdots a_N = p_1^{c_{11} + c_{21} + \cdots + c_{N1}} \cdots p_k^{c_{1k} + c_{2k} + \cdots + c_{Nk}}
$$

To satisfy $a_1 \cdots a_N = M$, this means for each prime $p_j$:

$$
c_{1j} + c_{2j} + \cdots + c_{Nj} = b_j
$$

This is where **combinatorics** comes in.

 üéØ **Counting the Number of Solutions**

Each equation like:

$$
c_{1j} + c_{2j} + \cdots + c_{Nj} = b_j \quad \text{with } c_{ij} \geq 0
$$

is a classical "**stars and bars**" problem. The number of non-negative integer solutions is:

$$
\binom{b_j + N - 1}{b_j}
$$

And since there are $k$ such independent equations (one for each prime), the total number of solutions is the product:

$$
\prod_{j=1}^k \binom{b_j + N - 1}{b_j}
$$

Example: $M = 12, N = 2$**

* $12 = 2^2 \cdot 3^1$
* For prime 2 ($b = 2$): Distribute 2 among 2 slots ‚Üí $\binom{2 + 2 - 1}{2} = \binom{3}{2} = 3$
* For prime 3 ($b = 1$): Distribute 1 among 2 slots ‚Üí $\binom{2}{1} = 2$
* Total ordered tuples: $3 \times 2 = 6$

‚úÖ These correspond to tuples:

* $(1,12), (2,6), (3,4), (4,3), (6,2), (12,1)$


 üîÅ **Why this works (Core Idea):**

We‚Äôre distributing the **prime powers** of $M$ to $N$ different numbers $a_i$.

* Multiplying numbers is like **adding exponents**.
* So, to get the product equal to $M$, the **total exponents must add up correctly**.
* For each prime, we **count how many ways we can distribute its exponent** across $N$ numbers.
* Then, we multiply all those counts together.

üß† Final Insight

Every number can be broken into primes. You're just figuring out how to **split the exponents of those primes** into $N$ pieces. The number of ways to do this gives the number of tuples whose product is $M$.

You want to find:

> After exactly **k moves** between **n initially occupied rooms**, how many **distinct combinations** of people in the rooms are possible?

Each move transfers a person from one room to another, so:

* Total number of people remains **n**
* Each move shifts one person from room `i ‚Üí j`
* You want to count the number of possible **final distributions of people** across the rooms after **exactly k moves**

‚úÖ What This Code Really Does

It computes:

$$
\text{Answer} = \sum_{i=0}^{\min(n, k)} \binom{n}{i} \cdot \binom{n - 1}{n - i - 1} \pmod{10^9 + 7}
$$
 üîπ Meaning of Each Term:

* $i$: number of **rooms that are empty** at the end.
* $\binom{n}{i}$: number of ways to choose `i` empty rooms
* $\binom{n - 1}{n - i - 1}$: number of ways to **distribute `k` moves** so that each of the remaining `n - i` rooms has **at least one person** (ensuring none of them become empty)

The sum is over all possible valid numbers of empty rooms, constrained by `k` (you can‚Äôt have more than `k` empty rooms because you can't "vacuum" a room unless someone leaves it via a move).

 üîÅ In Short:

You are using **inclusion-exclusion + constrained composition** to count how many **ways `k` people can move** so that **final room counts are valid**.
