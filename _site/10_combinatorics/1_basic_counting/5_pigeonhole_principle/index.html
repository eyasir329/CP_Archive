- Suppose a flock of pigeons fly into a set of pigeonholes to roost. If there are more pigeons than pigeonholes, then there must be at least 1 pigeonhole that has more than one pigeon in it.

- If k+1 or more objects are placed into k boxes, then there is at least one box containing two or more objects.

A. Among 50 people, what is the number of people that must be born on the same month?
-&gt; ceil(50/12) = 4.16... =&gt; 5 

B. How many students in a class must there be to ensure that 3 students get the same grade (one of A, B, C, D, or F)?
-&gt; ceil(N/5) = 3 =&gt;then consider, (N-1)/5 = 2(3-1) =&gt; N = 10+1 = 11
